Here's where we will fill in all your work.
The h3 and h4 are your headers. These help split the links into categories.
The <a ... part is a link.

Replace the google link with the link to your Work
Replace "Work Title [Journal]" with whatever you like.

The <br> is a line brake. This makes sure each link is on a new line.
